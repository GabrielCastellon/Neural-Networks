# Neural-Networks
Exercise #1: Single-layer network successfully identifies the sum pattern with a simple architecture.
Exercise #2: Introduction of a more complex two-layer network demonstrates varying prediction outcomes with increased model complexity.
Exercise #3: Enlarging the dataset improves the performance of the single-layer network, emphasizing the importance of sufficient training data.
Exercise #4: Expansion of the multi-layer network to handle a larger dataset highlights the trade-off between generalization and model complexity.
Exercise #5: Introduction of a three-input multi-layer network demonstrates sensitivity to changes in input dimensionality. The contrast between Results #5 and #6 emphasizes how additional input features affect the predicted sum, highlighting the importance of considering input characteristics during model building. Collectively, the exercises highlight the importance of dataset size, network architecture, and input dimensionality in influencing neural network performance. The selection of these parameters is crucial and should correspond to individual work needs. Iterative neural network development with constant testing and analysis is critical for improving models and obtaining optimal performance. Overall, this comprehensive study advances our knowledge of the dynamics involved in training and evaluating feedforward neural networks for pattern recognition tasks.
